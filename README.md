# About me
## My Hobbies
	- I enjoy learning much about the Cybersecurity industry and look to progress my 	knowledge each day in it
	- I profusely enjoy nature and being out doors when I can. Growing up in wooded areas 	is something I am used to
## Websites I recommend
	- [History](https://www.history.com) - A great place to research different 		timelines of history and events.
	- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - Best place to find videos on any topic 		or subject. Especially tutorials.
